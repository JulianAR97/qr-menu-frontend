## Why Use
### Our platform is offering 3 different types of handling of your QR code needs:
  - ##### **Single File Upload** Will generate a QR code specifically for a file you'll upload,
  - ##### **QR Menu** Allows you to generate the only one code and be able to swap a file attached to it (menu updates).
  - ##### **QR Link** Accepts any URL address and generates a QR for it

## How it Works?
##### Just post the QR code at your establishment on a sign, flyer, or inside your printed menu.Customers then scan the code with their smart phone and see your menu right on their phone. You get to update prices and items whenever you want, with instant changes reflected on your menus â€“ without incurring webmaster or designer fees.
