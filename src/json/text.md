## Why Use?
### Our platform is offering 3 different types of handling of your QR code needs:
  - ##### **Single File Upload** Will generate a QR code specifically for a file you'll upload,
  - ##### **QR Menu** Allows you to generate the only one code and be able to swap a file attached to it (menu updates).
  - ##### **QR Link** Accepts any URL address and generates a QR for it

## How it Works?
##### Just post the QR code at your establishment on a sign, flyer, or inside your printed menu.Customers then scan the code with their smart phone and see your menu right on their phone. You get to update prices and items whenever you want, with instant changes reflected on your menus â€“ without incurring webmaster or designer fees.

## About QR-Menu.rest
##### At its core, QR-Menu.rest is a free and convenient way to upload and share files of all sorts, from PDFs and document files to image files and even video files. The inspiration for the project came during a period of civil uncertainty, where during COVID-19 the general public became increasingly aware of the spread of disease, and companies struggled to stay afloat financially. As somebody who has a background managing fine dining establishments, I know how important it is to provide the best possible experience for your customers while also watching the bottom dollar. I believe it is these establishments that will benefit from this product the most, as it offers an easy way to update their everchanging menus without spending a dime on printing costs.
